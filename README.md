# Project Title

A project developed during the 2017 UCF Hackathon. This project was made to power a robot that would scan its surroundings looking for its "mama". Once located it would approach quacking the whole way. It was trained on images of a group member's face. OpenCV was used for facial recognition hosted on a raspberry pi. The arduino was used to receive steering and speed commands which it would interpret and send to the motors/servos.

## Deployment

Made for deployment on a raspberry pi combined with an arduino mega, servos and motors.
